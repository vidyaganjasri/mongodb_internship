# 📘 MongoDB Overview

## 🧾 What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a **general-purpose document-oriented database** designed for **flexibility, scalability, and performance**.

- Stores data in **JSON-like structures**.
- Schema is **flexible**, making it ideal for modern application development.
- Used in **personal projects, startups, and enterprise applications**.

## 🧱 Core Concepts

| Term         | Description                                |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Document** | Basic unit of data in MongoDB (similar to JSON) |
| **Collection** | Grouping of documents (like tables in RDBMS) |
| **Database** | Container for collections                   |

## 📄 Document Model

MongoDB stores data as **documents**, structured similarly to JSON:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "ACE"
}
```
## 📄 Document Storage Format

Internally stored as **BSON** (Binary JSON), allowing additional datatypes not present in standard JSON.

### Supported Types:
- Strings  
- Numbers (int, double, etc.)  
- Dates  
- Arrays  
- Booleans  
- `ObjectId` (unique identifier)

---

### `_id` Field
- Every document **must** have an `_id` field (acts as the **primary key**).
- If not provided, MongoDB **automatically generates** it.

---

## 🔁 Flexible Schema

- No rigid structure: documents in the same collection can have **different fields and data types**.
- Easy to **iterate and evolve** your schema as application needs change.

> 🆚 In relational databases, even small schema changes often require modifying multiple related tables (dependencies).  
> ✅ In MongoDB, just update your classes and insert new documents.
