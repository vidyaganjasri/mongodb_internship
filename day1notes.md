kk so there is 
front-end: userinterface 
back-end: server, app logic adn database 

we send request from frontend to backend using api's 
the request is first send to server then it is redirected to applogic which 
takes the help of database 

ex:requesting the server to fetch the data, which teakes to teh 
app logic,to fetch all the data stored in database, which is again sent to the 
server as the response to the front-end and shown to the ui 

This is client-server architecture  : Q asked in amazon interview 
front-end in client side while backend is on the server side 
request response life cycle


full-stack development: responsible for complete construction of the project/application
including front-end, back-end and api's 

MERN: 
MongoDB: Document Database( NoSQL)
          not arranging in any kinde of tables
Express(.js):Node js framework
React: is a library not a framework
Node: Runtime env, javascript based

library: a set of builtin code 
framework: along with the builtin code, it provides the structure too.

Ex: lib in colleges and school, books we can use it whenever we want,take it use it and 
return in 
framework, all guides us instead of just going and getting ourselves books, framework provides 
a structure, like in the first year, which books should we refer, gives us a roadmap 



Node js is runtime env for javascript
used to execute js files, need this driver to be executed 


front-end responseible for the appearance of the application 
website si collection of webpages
Front-end
HTML: 
CSS: 
Javascript: dynaimci
TypeScript: 


react comes with abilites of  html, css and js
if going with traditional ones have to learn for everything 

React is not a framework 
front-end framework 
Angular 
React: Next.js
vue


Back-end: 
consists of db, applogic, business logic, and a server 
running behind the scenes, ensuring the 

languages: 
Python, java, php, c#, Rupy on rails


benefits of this full stack :...
